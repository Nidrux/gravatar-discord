## INSTALLATION

DOWNLOAD DRIVERS FOR FIREFOX (Geckodriver)

You will need to download additional components to work with each of the major browsers. The drivers for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft's IE and Edge web browsers are all standalone executables that should be placed on your system PATH. Apple's safaridriver is shipped with Safari 10 for OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra. You will need to enable Remote Automation in the Develop menu of Safari 10 before testing.
